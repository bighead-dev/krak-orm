Krak
====

Simple, fast, flexible ORM for CI 3.0.

## Installation Guide

1. Move the `Krak/` directory into `./application/third_party/`
2. Move `config.php` into `./application/config/krak.php`
3.  Then just place this piece of code anywhere in your ci installation
    `require_once './application/third_party/Krak/Model.php'`. At the bottom of the `index.php` file is probably the best
